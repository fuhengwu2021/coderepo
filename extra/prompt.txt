Here are their requirements:
Model: meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct
Context size: Varies between 10k tokens to 2M token request
Concurrency: 50 requests
Does anyone have bandwidth to test run if the latest vllm or sglang work for the following?
Llama-4-Scout on 8x H200 with a max context length of 2M / 2097152

Our previous results showed 1.5M max context length with 8xH200

This is from a new customer ask
And, interestingly, I am seeing Brazil customers are using llama4 in 4 DACs with 10 replicas in total (cc @jingqzha @wwgao)

@tejanand Can you pick it up? I can guide you with this.
Unfortunately, most of the team is out already or are going out soon.

Due to the time limitation, just focus on checking if sglang/vllm works for 2M context length.
Just test 2M input length + 200 output length
